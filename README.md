# Live-Weather-Forecast-using-Python
Programing Language :Python. 
Libraries Used : Beautiful Soup, Requests. 
1) This project will show you how to create a Python script to get the weather forecast.
2) The script simply asks the user to enter the city name and in return, it displays the day, time, weather status and temperature.

Project Information :-
Installing the BeautifulSoup package in Python is the first step towards obtaining the current weather conditions of any place. Using the pip command, you can quickly install this Python library on your computer:

pip install beautifulsoup4

You may now begin working on this assignment by importing the required Python libraries after installing this library. Following the import of the libraries, we must use Google to scrape a city's weather updates. Here's how to use Python to accomplish it:

The code that I've supplied searches Google for a city, and then it scrapes information about that city, including its location, time, information, and weather. Following the execution of the aforementioned Python code, the output is displayed below.

Summary:-
Thus, this is how you may use your web scraping abilities to acquire real-time weather information for any city. I hope my post on using Python to acquire real-time weather information was enjoyable for you. These concepts can be applied to the development of a final-year project in which an interactive user interface-based application is demonstrated.
